# go-first-steps
Repository dedicated to learn go's basics. 


## Books
	* The Go Programming Language
	* Distributed Computing. Principles, Algorithms, and Systems.


## Warning
It's just the code that I did, examples and "tools/libs" following real projects (in that case is always specified). Most of them are not completed yet.
