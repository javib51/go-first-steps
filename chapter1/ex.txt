 It’s
 not
 a
 problem
 if
 the
 map
 doesn’t
 yet
 contain
 that
 key.
 The
 first
 time
 a 
 new
 line
 is
 seen
,
 the
 expression
 counts[line]
 on
 the
 right-hand
 side
 evaluates
 to
 the
 zero
 value
 for
 its
 type
, 
 which
 is
 0
 for
 int.
 To
 print
 the
 results
,
 we
 use
 another
 range-based
 for
 loop
, 
 this
 time
.
